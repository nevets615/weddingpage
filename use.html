          <h3>Oak Island, North Carolina</h3>
          <p>
            Oak Island has been a part of my life since I was born. I have had some of the best times of my life here. I have also had a chance to share new memories with Kayla here over the last few years. It's a quiet island on the eastern most point of North Carolina. There is no boardwalk or commercial properties along the beach. Just houses as far as you can see. It's located only 45 minutes from both Wilmington and Myrtle Beach. There is also a cozy little town called Southport just a few minutes drive.
            I'm happy to have many of my loved ones come and celebrate this very special occasion, in a place that has brought me so much joy. As I marry a women that I love so much.

          <p>
            We chose to rent a beautiful beachfront house located on the western
            most point of Oak Island to host the wedding. This is where the
            reception will be held. We check in on Friday October the 11th at 4:00 pm and check out on Monday the 14th at 11 am. 
            All are welcome to stop by any time and hang out.

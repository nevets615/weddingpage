          <h2>Our Story</h2>

          <p>
            <br /><br /><br />Here is what happened... <br />
            We were getting ready to go to Thanksgiving dinner at
            Carey's(sister) house and we were carrying things out the door.
            Steven's hands were full so he asked me to grab his keys out of his
            pocket. So I started to reach into his pocket and he yells "STOP.
            Hold these boxes and i'll get my keys." Thinking nothing of it we
            finished loading the car and we were on our way. <br />
            Some time goes by and a few cooking mishaps happen, dinner was
            delayed. We decided to all sit down and say what we are thankful for
            before the food is served. <br />
            It starts with Steven suggesting to Gene (brother-in=law) that he
            start.(He is sitting to the left of Steven.) Cathy(sister) piped in
            and said she wanted to start. (She was sitting on the other side of
            Gene.) I am intently listening to everyone talk. But Steven leaned
            over to Gene, who will now be going last, and says "Man, you're
            screwed." Which I did not hear because I was listening to the
            others. It becomes my turn "I am thankful for this family because
            they have taken me in and treated me as one of their own. I am far
            away from my wonderful family and I miss them. I am gald to have
            found this wonderful second family and to have their love and
            support." <br />
            Steven's up.<br />
            "I am thankful for my family and to have my girlfriend Kayla. She
            means a lot to me. I want her to be a permanent member of this
            family and become more than just my girlfriend. I want her to be my
            wife.(Gets down on one knee.) Kayla will you marry me??" <br />
            My answer while sobbing "Yes, of course, yes!" <br />
            We all looked at Gene because it was his turn. He was speechless.
            And those who know Gene know that is quite unlike Gene.

          <h2>Accommodations</h2>

          <p>
            <br /><br /><br />We will be blocking off a number of rooms at a hotel close to the location of both the ceremony and the reception. If you wish to take advantage of this please RSVP before July 31st. This way we can have an accurate count of the number of rooms we need to have blocked off and the dates we need to have them. The more people that take advantage of this the bigger the discount you will receive. Feel free to make your own accomadation, if you would like. As soon as we have the details for the hotel we will have the link for the hotel and the access code you will need to make your reservation and receive the discount here. Please check back later this week for more details. 
            <!-- Please see the Reserved Hotel section in the more info page to get details on the hotel. -->

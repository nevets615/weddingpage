          <h2>Our Story</h2>

          <p>
            <br/> <br/>Here is what happened... <br/> We were getting ready to go to Thanksgiving dinner at Carey's(sister) house and we were carrying things out the door. Steven's hands were full so he asked me to grab his keys out of his pocket. So I started to reach into his pocket and he yells "STOP. Hold these boxesand i'll get my keys." Thinking nothing of it we finished loading the car and we were on our way. <br/> Some time goes by and a few cooking mishaps happen, dinner was delayed. We decided to all sit down and say what we are thankful for before the food is served. <br/> It starts with Steven suggesting to Gene (brother-in=law) that he start.(He is sitting to the left of Steven.) Cathy(sister) piped in and said she wanted to start. (She was sitting on the other side of Gene.) I am intently listening to everyone talk. But Steven leaned over to Gene, who will not be going last, and says "Man, you're screwed." Which I did not hear because I was listening to the others. It becomes my turn "I am thankful for this family because they have taken me in and treated me as one of their own. I am far away from my wonderful family and I miss them. I am gald to have found this wonderful second family and to have their love and support." <br/> Steven's up.<br/> "I am thankful for my family and to have my girlfriend Kayla. She means a lot to me. I want her to be a permanent member of this family and become more than just my girlfriend. I want her to be my wife.(Gets down on one knee.) Kayla will you marry me??" <br/> My answer while sobbing "Yes, of course, yes!" <br/> We all looked at Gene because it was his turn. He was speechless. And those who know Gene know that is quite unlike Gene.
